## Purpose
Raw Text: [Here, you will explain in 1-2 lines why your app exists. Think of this as your "blurb". e.g. Meowtfits is a shopping app that allows users to buy different outfits for their cats.]

## Features
* [List each feature you will implement. e.g. Ability to view outfit pages with photos. Filter by cat size. Users can share outfit page listings with friends.]

## Control Flow
* [Walk us through how your app would work - how the user would interact with it, starting from the initial screen. e.g. Users are initially presented with a splash screen, where they can log in or browse as a guest. Once done, they see a curated list of some of the newest and coolest cat outfits. Tapping on a cat outfit entry takes you to that cat outfit's listing page.]

## Implementation

### Model
* [List the files in your Model, e.g. Item.Swift]
### View
* [List your different Views, e.g. OutfitListTableView]
### Controller
* [List the files in your Controller, e.g. OutfitListTableViewController]
