For login, use this API: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/

Need static cells for the store view
I’m thinking cells with an image on left, description, and price, maybe aisle number on the right.
3 sections right now
have to fix auto layout for the table static cell heights to fit different devices

have to use stack overflow code to set height of text box for address

Still need to integrate firebase API to do login. It seems like we can also use this to find nearest stores (if we end up implementing this.)

Still need to unwind segue for the “create account” branch of storyboard

All the tableviews are basically done. Information passing between VCs is all good except for passing the store to the cart for looking up pricing. (fix this soon.)
